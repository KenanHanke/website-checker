# Website Checker

This is a native Android app for website maintainers that checks if specified
websites are down. This can be done manually within the app, but also automatically
occurs in the background every two hours (as long as there's a network connection).
A notification is sent if a website is found to be unreachable.

The app is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using
[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) with themed widgets
from Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) design language.
